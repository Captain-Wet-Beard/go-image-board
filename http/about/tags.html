<h4>Standard Tags</h4>
<p>Tags are pieces of information that can be associated with an image or collection that makes searching for the image/collection easier. Tags should be short and concise. Consider adding tags for the image's genre, theme, media, author, and important elements contained within the image.</p>
<h5>Collections</h5>
<p>Collections are tagged automatically by their member images. When an image is added or removed from a collection or when an image in a collection is tagged or untagged, the same tag operations are performed on a collection. Collections cannot be directly tagged.</p>
<h4>MetaTags</h4>
<p>These are special tags that are automatically associated with an image. These are built into Go! Imageboard, and not uploaded by users.</p>
<p>MetaTags follow the same general format. [TagName]:[comparator][value]. comparator is defaulted to "=" if not provided. Example, rating:everyone is converted to rating:=everyone in the background. Not all tags support the same comparators.</p>
