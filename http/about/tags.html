<h4>Standard Tags</h4>
<p>Tags are pieces of information that can be associated with an image that makes searching for the image easier. Tags should be short and concise. Consider adding tags for the image's genre, theme, media, author, and important elements contained within the image.</p>
<h4>MetaTags</h4>
<p>These are special tags that are automatically associated with an image. These are built into Go! Imageboard, and not uploaded by users.</p>
<p>MetaTags follow the same general format. [TagName]:[comparator][value]. comparator is defaulted to "=" if not provided. Example, rating:everyone is converted to rating:=everyone in the background. Not all tags support the same comparators.</p>
