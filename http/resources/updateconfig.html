				<p><strong>Hello!</strong> It appears that you have not set up your configuration file or we could not read it. A default config file has been generated for you if it did not exist already, but it still requires configuration. You may find the configuration file at <installDir>/configuration/config.json</p>
				
				<p>Once the config file has been updated, restart the application</p>
